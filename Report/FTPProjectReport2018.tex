\section{INTRODUCTION}

File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a protocol which is used  to transfer files between two hosts over a TCP or IP network~\cite{FTPbeginners}. In it's operation FTP makes use of two TCP connections, a control connection and a data connection. The control connection, used to send control information, is opened and remains open throughout the duration of the user session~\cite{topDownApproach6th}. The data connection is non-persistent; a new data connection is established for each new file transfer~\cite{topDownApproach6th}. The main objectives of FTP include the promotion of file sharing, to encourage the use of remote computers, to shield users from variations in file storage systems among hosts and to ensure reliable and efficient data transfer~\cite{rfc959}. 

%Using the python programming language as well as basic socket methods, a File Transfer Application is designed and tested. Additionally, a basic FTP User Interface (UI) is developed to interact with the remote FTP server in an intuitive way.

Detailed within the sections below are a overview of the implemented system and its command/reply messaging exchange, a working description of the system and code base,the results of system testing and a critical analysis thereof. Also included is the division of work between the project partners.

\section{SYSTEM DESCRIPTION} % talk about implemented functions and features from a client perspective
% talk about what features were implemented in general (what couldn't be implemented and why)

An FTP client and server pair has been designed and implemented as per RFC959 specifications~\cite{rfc959}. By implementing the system in such a way, both the server and client are compatible standardised servers and clients. A limitation of the system is that it is not designed for any platform other than the Windows OS.

\subsection{FTP Server}

Interaction with the server is handled in command line through a list of server instructions capable of doing some stuff.

\subsection{FTP Client UI}

The FTP client is handled by a simple UI. %%%%TALK ABOUT THIS


\subsection{FTP Client Logic}

Interaction with the FTP server is handled by the \texttt{clientLogic} class. This class has functionality matching that of the FTP server as to be able to send the server the commands which it wishes to pursue.
