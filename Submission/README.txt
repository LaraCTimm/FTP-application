<1> In order to run our code (if not connecting to a remote server), 
the server must be run using the following command: 


python FTPserver.py


<2> Following, in a separate command window, the client interface can be run
as follows:


python interface.py


*PLEASE NOTE*
Both the client and server have been programmed using Python 2.7. Therefore 
if your default Python compiler is not Python 2 the 'python' command, as 
used above, should be adapted accordingly (eg. 'python2 FTPserver.py')
